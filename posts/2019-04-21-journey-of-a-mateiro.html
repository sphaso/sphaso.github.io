        <p><em>In this ever-evolving post I’ll talk a bit about my connection to yerba mate, discoveries, tips, and a small review of the brands I’ve tried. Everything is mixed together to ease the narration.</em></p>
<p>I had never heard of yerba mate until I’ve met Irimara. Mara is the reason a lot of things happened in my life. I was about to graduate from a masters program when our paths crossed. When looking at her pictures on Facebook the environment and depiction looked so familiar, yet with an aura of mystery. Mara is from Porto Alegre, Brazil, a country unknown to me. The only connection I had to Porto Alegre was the social forum in the early 2000s I had heard so much about.<br />
Mara’s English was shaky so communication was not easy. I decided to learn Portuguese, how hard could it be? with a lot of patience on her side, within a month we were talking in Portuguese with much more ease. This was her first gift to me. Another topic she would bring up from time to time was mate. I decided to try this magical tea. The only seller I found in my town was from Fair Trade. I didn’t have any of the proper equipment and couldn’t find any shop online. I came up with my own method to drink mate:</p>
<p><strong>How I used to prepare mate, the cringy way</strong><br />
Take a regular pot. Heat up the water with a decent quantity of leaves in it. The water needs to turn green. Once it feels hot enough filter it into a mug. Enjoy. Or not.</p>
<p>Thinking back. That wasn’t even mate. The leaves didn’t look like the ones I drink now at all. The preparation process was careless and didn’t help. Still, I was drinking “mate” and sharing this connection to a girl from the other side of the world. You don’t need all the fancy stuff to make mate when you’re starting out, some people use a French press, others put their bombilla into a mug or filter the leaves with a tea ball. Enjoy mate however you can.<br />
A short while after I met another girl from Porto Alegre, Juliana. You should know there’s a bit of a race issue in the mate world. Mara is black and she would drink regular yerba mate. When I asked her about tereré (cold mate) she told me only stupid people drink it. Tereré is part of gaucho culture (South American cowboys - but also very common in Paraguay, where it’s considered a national symbol). When I asked her about the Farroupilha celebrations of her region she got hostile, and perhaps rightly so. Juliana is white, and like many white people in that region she drinks chimarrão. Chimarrão is powdered green mate. It’s powdered, very green and fresh, regular mate is in leaves and dried. It looks like Matcha but the taste is different. It tastes completely different from mate in leaves too. Except I didn’t know all that at the time, I thought chimarrão was just the local dialect for mate.</p>
<p>It was Fall 2011. Fast forward a few years. I’m living in Italy with Delie, who’s Mexican. She has a hard time finding ingredients for Mexican food, so we decide to go to a famous store in Chinatown, Milan. While Delie picks the ingredients, I wander to a corner and there I find a small mate shrine: bowls, bombillas (the filtered straws), and of course, the yerba. I have mixed feelings about trying the real thing after so many years, but Delie talks me into it. I’m very grateful to her for actually initiating this journey, which is ironic because she absolutely despises the taste of mate. I bought a small bowl, a cheap bombilla, and half a kg of minted Campesino. It was Spring 2017.<br />
Coming home I watched every youtube video I could on how to prepare mate, take care of the bowl, the traditional way to drink it.</p>
<p><strong>How to cure a calabaça bowl</strong> Calabaça is a fruit that grows in South America. It looks a bit like a pumpkin and you might be familiar with it because it’s used as a resonance chamber for the Berimbau. It being nothing more than a dried fruit, you might want to give it a wash before drinking from it. If what you bought is a porongo cuia (that’s the traditional brazilian bowl, open on top instead of closing down) you shouldn’t need to worry and you can use it straight away.<br />
Check if there are impurities and small pieces of the fruit in your bowl (brush a finger against the inside), if so, you need to “cure it”. This is how:<br />
1) gently scrub the inside walls of the bowl with a small spoon. Be careful about the stem on the bottom. Don’t break it! What you’re scrubbing out is spongy material in excess. In the next steps you’ll notice just how spongy this fruit is<br />
2) wash it out with cold water<br />
3) fill it 3/4 with yerba and pour water at 70°. Leave it 12 to 24 hours refilling with cold water when necessary<br />
4) empty the bowl, scrub again, wash again. You’re ready!</p>
<p>Some people say that a cabalaça can cure itself and there’s some truth to that. If you don’t use it for a long time the taste will get more bitter and acid. I do think however that you should scrub it once you buy it.</p>
<p>After I cured the bowl, I obviously wanted to try the Campesino. Little did I know that Campesino is made for tereré and it tastes a bit funny with hot water. I figured it was an acquired taste and finished my half kg in a few weeks. One problem I had at the beginning was that the yerba would get “lavado”, meaning I wasn’t able to leave dry leaves on top to make the drink last longer. One thing you might not realise is that one drinks one liter or more of mate each sitting. You pour and pour and pour until you either had enough or the leaves taste bland. Little secret: this works for most teas, if it’s not cheapo tea bags you can have multiple cups.</p>
<p>Enter Bianca. Bianca is a colleague from an Argentinian family. She’s not an hardcore mateira but her mom is. I asked her about my lavado issue and she provided many insights. She also relayed a lot of good information from her mother. It’s funny to think about now but I was pretty frustrated about my lavado issue, her tips kept me going in this journey.<br />
What you need to understand is that making mate is an art. One needs to practice and practice until they get decent at it. Even the way I pour water in the bowl changed over time. This is what I like about it: it’s not just something you drink, it’s something you make and it can be different every time depending on how much yerba you use, water temperature, the position of the leaves in the bowl and who knows what else. I still wonder if the yerba prepared by someone brought up in this world would taste the same. Perhaps there’s something small but yet so important I’m missing?</p>
<p><strong>How I prepare mate in a calabaça</strong><br />
1) fill 3/4 of the bowl with yerba. I like to use a small funnel for this not to make a mess<br />
2) prepare a small quantity of cold water in your thermos. It’s important to have a thermos that allows to pour a small quantity of water, not just an aluminium bottle with a cap<br />
3) start heating up a pot of water. Use a thermometer, don’t let the water get past 75°C<br />
3) put a hand on the opening of the bowl, turn it upside down and shake it shake it baby!<br />
4) turn the bowl at a 125° angle and remove your hand. You should see the opening of the bowl sort of divided in half by the yerba. If not repeat from 3, but don’t worry too much about it, if it’s a small bowl it’s bound to get lavado at the second pour anyway<br />
5) start pouring cold water from the opposite side, trying to have it trickle down without hitting the yerba. This will allow the water to sit below most of the yerba and lift the dry leaves (this part is extremely difficult so no stress)<br />
6) turn the bowl straight slowly as the water fills it up<br />
7) take your trusty bombilla, close one end with a thumb and insert it in the calabaça until it hits the bottom<br />
8) the cold water should have disappeared by now, fill the bowl with hot water, try not to hit the dry yerba on top<br />
9) enjoy!</p>
<p>In summer 2017 Delie gifted me a small trove of mate stuff: half a kg of Cruz de Malta, half a kg of Nobleza Gaucha, a palo santo cuia, a plated cuia, a bombilla.<br />
By this time I had realised that Campesino was supposed to be drank as tereré but I didn’t want to alter my calabaça by putting lemon juice (more on tereré later) so I was very excited to try Cruz.<br />
<strong>Memories of Cruz de Malta</strong><br />
Cruz is a very famous brand among mateiros. A past boyfriend of Delie used to drink this brand exclusively. As most Argentinian brands it’s very smoky and one needs to be careful with infusion time and water temperature. I probably tried it in both madeira (i.e. wood) and calabaça but it’s been too long to recall. I suspect the taste would get too strong in calabaça while it’s most enjoyable in wood. I remember experimenting with water temperature, reaching the conclusion that 72°C was the threshold for a good Cruz (I tried from 68° to 82°), but I know people who drink it past 75°C. Ultimately I was too inexperienced in the preparation to fully enjoy it.</p>
<p>Let’s talk a bit about wood.</p>
<p><strong>How to take care of wooden cuias</strong><br />
Wood and calabaça give completely different tastes to your mate. There’s been a period when I drank from wood exclusively and still prefer it for most Argentinian brands. People will tell you that wooden bowls need to be cured with milk and butter. Being vegan, I refused to go down this path. Wood is generally easier to use, it’s easier not to have lavado issues and cleaning them is much faster. There are, however, two issues: mold and dryness.<br />
I thought mold was something that only happened to dirty people until I lost a good cuia to it. Here’s a few tips to avoid mold:<br />
- don’t leave yerba in the cuia  bowl overnight<br />
- clean your cuia  bowl with a spoon (the bombilla might scratch it) and dry it with a piece of cloth<br />
- it won’t be dry-dry, so leave it on the table until it’s properly dry. I leave my calabaça bowl upside down on the dish rack, but for wood I prefer to leave it on the table<br />
In case mold actually happens you need to act fast:<br />
- pour a small shot of vodka inside, shake it so that it gets soaked<br />
- light it up and move the bowl so that it doesn’t burn down and all the walls get a proper roasting<br />
- put out the fire (way before the wood actually turns black!) and cure it  use it<br />
- the taste might not be great but bowls before hoes<br />
I was able to save a wood cuia with this method for a few weeks until mold regrew with a vengeance and had to trash it. It was not palo santo thank god. Let’s talk about dryness now.<br />
When you feel your wooden cuia is particularly dry to the touch, you need to treat it with vegetable oil. I like to use coconut oil like so:<br />
- soak your hands with a table spoon of coconut oil<br />
- pass it on the cuia, outside and inside<br />
- leave it to soak for a couple of hours<br />
- clean it off with a dry cloth</p>
<p><strong>Memories of Nobleza Gaucha (special guests: Rosamonte and La tranquera)</strong><br />
After I finished my Cruz, I tried Nobleza Gaucha. I was told both were very good and I was surprised by how different they were. Cruz is a heavy hitter, sometimes it tastes like an ashtray. At this point, after the hot Campesino and the Cruz, I thought all mate tastes like this. Nobleza however is much more round and enjoyable to me. It’s rarely harsh and fills you up nicely without leaving you hyperactive  overcaffeinated. In this regard it reminds me of Rosamonte. Both are perfectly fine in calabaça and wood, but I prefer wood. If you’re new to mate these are probably the two brands I would recommend.<br />
At this point you might be wondering what do I actually drink from calabaça. Well, La Tranquera. Tranquera is another Argentinian brand similar to Rosamonte that I find much better brewed in calabaça. It probably has a bit more caffeine than Rosamonte and the taste is thicker (although any mate brewed in calabaça will have a stronger taste).</p>
<p>Let’s get real by talking about substance abuse. Mate can be abused just like coffee. It’s a stimulant. The effects are fairly different from coffee. For example I can drink a liter or more of mate at night and get a good sleep, while it wouldn’t be possible after an americano. I grew in Italy and started drinking espresso at about 11, at the family table, for breakfast. Some people get shocked when I tell them this, but it’s fairly common. There was a time when I was drinking way more coffee than I should have, but ultimately it never impacted my life that much.<br />
Coffee is strong and short-lived, mate is weaker but lingering. Some people have trouble drinking it, they feel their heart pounding. Others drink it every day only until 3pm. My regular mate drinking pattern is: a small bowl on Friday night to celebrate the incoming weekend, dry on Saturday (perhaps a bowl of matcha for breakfast), chimarrão on Sunday. In the summer I have some tereré after work to freshen up. If it’s a long weekend I drink more, or if I’m home sick or on holiday I might take advantage of it. In each sitting I drink from 1 to 2 liters depending if I’m drinking in bowl, cuia, the state of the yerba and my schedule.<br />
Establishing a pattern like this made it easier for me to realise how much I was drinking.</p>
<p><strong>“Fake” mate</strong><br />
Since we’re on the topic, let’s talk about energy drinks, mate de coca, and the acclaimed mate for weight loss. When I first went to Germany, Delie introduced me to Club Mate. It’s a very popular drink especially amongst programmers. It’s bitter, fresh, and fizzy. It tastes nothing like mate and that shouldn’t be a surprise if you look at the label, since there’s like 0,01% of actual mate in it. The kick comes from all the caffeine they put. I still enjoy it and drink liters of it whenever I go to Germany, but I wouldn’t call it mate.<br />
Some colleagues who went to South America brought mate de coca back. I’m sorry to say it has nothing to do with yerba mate. Mate de coca is a tea made with coca leaves, yerba mate is from Ilex Paraguanensis, a completely different plant that does not release alcaloids.<br />
Mate is also sold in tea bags for weight loss. I’m not sure why someone would think that they can reduce their weight by drinking a cup of green tea, but I do feel a bit less hungry when drinking it, so there might be something to it.</p>
<p>All in all, as I said, what I enjoy is the preparation process and the contemplative nature of drinking mate while studying, programming or playing a strategy game. The bottled or tea bagged versions don’t attract me the same way. I don’t drink mate to lose weight either, I’m not sure why I do drink it at this point. It’s just a small vice I picked up I guess. Mate can be drank in various forms and ulimately it’s up to you if you want to turn gaucho all the way or drink it like any other regular tea. There are pictures of guarani drinking mate and their method obviously didn’t involve silver filters and thermometers.<br />
Two ways one can drink mate is as tereré and chiamarrão.</p>
<p><strong>Tereré (and a few words on Campesino)</strong><br />
Tereré is cold mate. That’s it. Well, not really. There’s a whole imagery of gauchos on their horses drinking tereré from a guampa (a horn), but as mentioned people in Paraguay drink it just as much. Being vegan, I avoided the guampa and started with a regular mug. If you have a mug that’s a bit slanted it will help with the lavado issue. There’s many reasons why one might like cold mate better:<br />
- you don’t have to wait for the water to heat up to 72°C<br />
- you can drink a little and put it in the fridge for the next day (if you drink in ceramic)<br />
- it’s refreshing, a great pick-me-up for the summer days</p>
<p>The only tereré yerba I tried is Campesino, mint&amp;lemon variety. Campesino is a common brand in Paraguay and one can find it in different flavors. These flavors however are sprayed on the leaves and once you open it the quality can decay quickly. The first cup is usually very tasty. For this reason I like to add lemon juice and mint to my tereré. I even tried to add cocoa but I was scolded by a gaucho who told me it’s a “gringo shit”. So I stopped.<br />
Since I didn’t want to alter the taste of my other calabaça or wooden cuias, I’ve only tried tereré in ceramic mug, ceramic bowl, and in fruit (more on this later). The procedure to prepare tereré is the same as regular mate except you add cold water and ice cubes. I was told that any mate can be drank cold, but I’m not that convinced.<br />
In my experience the taste of a hot mate is fairly monodimensional. It gets blander after each pour but that’s it. There’s not hints of this, aftertaste of that. It’s just a green tea. Tereré is bit richer in this regard due to the added scents and ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>How to drink tereré from fruit</strong><br />
On instagram you see people drinking mate from any medium possible, including fruit. I was curious to try and thought that pomegrades would be great. Their skin is thick and the size is similar to that of a calabaça. I looked online to see if other people tried but couldn’t. I assume this is a personal recipe then.<br />
1) get a pomegrade and make a small hole on top, on the opposite side of the branch (the branch can be used to have the bowl sit straight, experiment with this)<br />
2) using a swiss knife and a tea spoon remove all the contents into a plate and enjoy some fresh fruit (this is going to take much longer than you expect, I promise)<br />
3) since I was stubborn I wanted to have it dry naturally under the sun. After 2 weeks I gave up and used the oven. Don’t be like me and just put your pomegrade into an oven at max 40°C for a few hours<br />
4) don’t leave it in the oven until it’s super dry, have it cool down outside and repeat. You don’t want the pomegrade skin to turn into mush or shrink too much<br />
5) scrub as necessary<br />
6) the pomegrade will never turn as dry as your favorite calabaça so as long as it’s thickish to the touch, feel free to try it out<br />
The only thing to be careful about using the pomegrade is that after drinking from it you need to dry it in the oven all over again. It’s a bit of a pain. When the summer was over I left it on a desk and it eventually turned into a ball of mold and had to be trashed, but I plan to experiment more with fruit in the coming months.<br />
Is it worth it? Absolutely. Fruit will add even more flavor to your tereré and drinking from a bowl I made was a small victory for me.</p>
<p><strong>A small tale about ceramic</strong><br />
One word of caution about ceramic. I once bought a ceramic bowl thinking that it would be much better than organic material since:<br />
- it probably keeps the temperature better<br />
- it doesn’t soak my precious hot water<br />
- it’s generally bigger than a calabaça bowl<br />
- it’s much faster to clean and can’t mold<br />
Oh boy I was naive. I didn’t consider one small con: the leaves don’t stick to the walls. Unless you have a very, very good bombilla, this is a problem. Currently I don’t even have a proper bombilla for chimarrão so the only thing I can drink from my ceramic bowl is tereré. Why tereré? because I can put less leaves, I only drink a little after dinner, so I have way more water volume than leaves. I still need to be careful not to choke the filter, but I’m getting there. I do see some people online who can drink from ceramic bowls and I honestly don’t know their secret. Care to share?</p>
<p>Let’s talk about chimãrrao now.<br />
When the student is ready, the mate meets the student. It wasn’t long until I had run out of all the mate Delie gifted me and had to go back to Milan. On our way to Chinatown we found a small Brazilian shop. It’s honestly the size of my living room and everyone inside spoke Portuguese. To my surprise they were selling Barão and I bought one kg. I was finally going to drink chimarrão the way gauchos do! Or so I thought.<br />
As mentioned, chimarrão is powdery and fresh, that means that special care needs to be taken regarding the cuia and bombilla, not to mention proper erva storage. Keep your chima in the fridge either in its original container (if it’s not paper, more on this later) or in a glass jar or tin box. You don’t want rotten erva, believe me. Regarding preparation, at first I was using my wood palo santo cuia. It’s not slanted and the surface on top is narrow. The powder was choking the filter and it was impossible to drink properly. I tried many times changing the quantity of erva, the water temperature, bombilla position etc. This is what worked for me:</p>
<p><strong>Chima tips and tricks from sphaso</strong><br />
Please note that making chima is particularly difficult. Frustration and disappointment will hunt you, you will second guess yourself to no end because nothing seems to work. Keep going!<br />
1) cuia selection: there are cuias made especially for chima, they’re bigger, made of porongo (=calabaça), and have a wide slanted area on top. If you don’t have one a wooden cuia could theoretically work. Avoid bowls or ceramic<br />
2) bombilla selection: there are bombillas made especially for chima, they look a bit like a sigmoid and have a spoon-shaped filter. I’ve never tried one. The one I use is a German design, the filter is hexagonal with horizontal cuts instead of the usual holes. It’s not perfect but still better than the usual triangle holed ones<br />
3) without the proper equipement and expertise the filter will choke immediately. What one can do to prevent it is to wrap something around the filter. Some tea bags work, people in South America use a “camisinha” (watch out, this can mean condom) which is a small bag of tissue. I sewed a linen camisinha once and it worked OK for a couple of weeks until it broke. There’s also a sort of “separator” that keeps the erva on one side of the cuia however I’ve never tried it<br />
4) even assuming you have the proper cuia, making a chimarrão that lasts more than half a liter is a challenge, why? it’s all a matter of physics. The idea is that you create an inverted pyramid on one side of the cuia. From the top, it can look a bit like a cave. The idea is that most of the erva is either stuck at a side or on top, leaving ample space on the bottom for clear water. This is where your filter will be, free and happy not to be choked by the powdered erva. The challenge then is this: too little erva so the filter won’t choke? the pyramid won’t stay up. Too much erva and you won’t have space on the bottom. Erosion is another factor. Maybe your pyramid is perfect for a couple of sips, then the outer part of the pyramid gets wet dragging the whole thing down. It’s a bit of a nightmare to be honest and I’m still to perfect my technique<br />
5) if the pyramid collapses (it will at some point no matter what) you might be thinking you lost a lot of good erva. Well, yes. But you can salvage it by pouring the chima into a glass from the cuia. It’s not the same thing but at least you can keep drinking it. Watch out, it’s bound to be VERY strong, it’s not just green water<br />
6) if you realize you’ve put too much erva or the bottom is muddy, you can dig some out with a tea spoon<br />
7) sometimes the filter chokes and you want to take it out to clean it. As it breaks the surface, water could come spitting out of the filter, watch out<br />
8) the erva is beautiful but it can also make an absolute mess, I always have some tissues around me when I drink it<br />
9) chima is strong, don’t underestimate the chima. If you feel your eyes are popping out, it’s probably time to end your sitting<br />
10) sometimes you can get a better drag by putting the filter right next to the clear wall, experiment with depth and strength too</p>
<p><strong>Memories of Barão</strong><br />
Barão is a popular tea brand in Rio Grande do Sul, aka chima land. It’s usually sold in vacuumed bags of 1kg and comes in two varieties: green bag is traditional, orange bag is a bit less bitter. I’ve only tried the green bag. The erva is extremely fresh and smells of cut grass, which is actually what it is. The tone is a dark green, so if you’re into chima competitions (yes, don’t get me started…) you won’t have that crazy neon green you see on instagram. The first time I tried it, I must have had a higher temperature and it tasted a lot like coffee. At the correct temperature it tastes less bitter, thick, very different from usual yerba. There’s no ashes undertone like an Argentinian yerba and it’s thicker and stronger than a green tea you might have at a Chinese restaurant.<br />
If you ever had Matcha (made traditionally with a bamboo brush, not the starbuck crap) you might be reminded of that not only for the color, the white foam, and the smell, but the degree of bitterness as well. There’s only one other chima I’ve tried.</p>
<p><strong>Memories of Chimarrão Gaucho</strong><br />
When Delie’s sister came to visit, I asked Delie if they could detour to buy me some mate since they were in Milan. To my surprise they found this chima brand I had never heard of before. There’s a reason I’ve never heard of it before, it’s because it’s not really chima.<br />
If you’re into Matcha tea, you should know that the leaves need to be grinded to a particular size to be called Matcha. Nothing like this happens in chima, the most important aspect is that it’s powdery, green, and fresh. The Chima Gaucho however was grinded very coarsly and it looked dried. I’m not sure if this is a regional difference or not, but I was surprised to see it sold in a paper bag to begin with. I don’t think it dried in storage because it would have rotten and broken the bag, I can only assume it was prepared this way.<br />
I wouldn’t say it’s bad, it’s just not what’s traditionally called a chima. The taste is not as vibrant, it tastes more like a mellow Argentinian yerba. I tried it in wood and porongo. I wouldn’t buy it again.</p>
<p>Nowadays, everywhere I go I look for mate shops. I know there’s 3 or 4 in Milan, although I’ve only been to two. There’s Amazon and online shops but the shipping cost is a bit prohibitive. I know a guy who has 10kg packages shipped to him from Brazil, but he told me the shipping cost is more than the actual yerba cost. When I went to Mexico I thought I would find mate everywhere, but I couldn’t find any. Same in Germany and Spain. Imagine my surprise when I was grocery shopping with Delie and she came back with a bag of Tarangui!<br />
For many Italians, Tarangui is the first introduction to yerba since it’s now sold in many supermarkets. It’s an Argentinian brand that comes in different types: blue and red bag, with or without stems (palos). It’s convenient to have mate readily available in my home town, but as you’ll read, I didn’t like it one bit.</p>
<p><strong>Memories of Tarangui (blue bag, con palos)</strong><br />
I was excited to find mate in my small town, but my excitement lowered on every sip. I first tried Tarangui in a calabaça. It honestly tasted like aspirin. I’ve never had a mate so acid. After half a liter it would turn into a more familiar ashtray, to soon disappear into bland hot water. It’s better in wood, where it loses a lot of the acid. As you know by now, I prefer round mates like Nobleza and Rosamonte. Tarangui is very sharp without having the richness of a Cruz. I was very surprised to hear that one of Delie’s friend’s boyfriend, who’s from Uruguay, buys Tarangui sin palos (he drinks sin palos exclusively). I don’t know if it’s an aquired taste or it’s just bad, but I’m not going to buy it again.</p>
<p>A few words on youtube tutorials. If you’re like me, you’ll watch hours of youtube to understand all the intricacies of a good mate preparation. The problem is that those tutorials only teach the beginning. Mate evolves on every sip, the leaves get soaked and fall, the erva absorbs water and it grows choking your filter. What to do in those situations? Very little exists on the subject which is however very important. All I want to say is, don’t expect your mate to stay the same from beginning to end. Experiment and see what works for you. One example everyone knows, people are very strict about positioning their bombilla and not to have it moved. This is BS. As you grow older in the mate world you discover what you suspected all the way: it’s perfectly OK to use the bombilla to mold the yerba to one side, people all other South America do it.</p>
<p>The journey continues. I’m currently sipping Rosamonte and Barão, but I have a few more brands in my cupboard to try: Pajarito, Poporé, Rosamonte special, CBSE, and a new flavor of Campesino. I’ll update this post with my new findings.</p>
