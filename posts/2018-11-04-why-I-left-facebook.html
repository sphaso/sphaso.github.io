        <p>On October 21st I decided to leave Facebook for good. What looks like an innocuous act hides a web of emotional, political, social, and practical consequences.</p>
<p>The reason why I left is that I didn’t find it all that interesting anymore, in fact, it was getting annoying.<br />
I would log in hoping to find engaging conversation, exciting news from friends, new people with whom to talk and work with. After some time I realized how excruciatingly difficult it was to find any of the former.<br />
My feed was a mix of ads for stuff I would never buy (animal products), hatred (fueled politically or otherwise), and an obnoxious amount of shitposts of a single friend amongst about 200.<br />
Moreover, I wasn’t really talking to anyone. My interactions with people were limited to likes and shares, a comment here and there and that’s it. I know that I had interesting friends that I would like to chat with. So why wasn’t I? How could leaving a social network help me… socialize?</p>
<p>Publicly announcing that I left the biggest social network of the past 10 years seems absurd. What’s so special about it? This absurdity makes it worth blogging.<br />
In the following paragraphs I’ll dissect some aspects of the exhile.</p>
<p><strong>Practical</strong> There’s many reasons why staying on Facebook might sound like a good idea, off the top of my head:<br />
1) friends and family is there<br />
2) ten years of my life are catalogued there<br />
3) it’s how I find events happening nearby<br />
4) it’s how most news reach me<br />
5) some groups or pages proved useful to me</p>
<p>This is how I solved them:<br />
1) I went through my friends list and contacted people I only had there to arrange a new medium of communication<br />
2) thank you GDPR! Facebook gives you the option of downloading every activity you had on the platform<br />
3 and 4) most news organizations or event promoters have an Instagram or Twitter account, so I simply added them there<br />
5) there was one group it would have been fairly hard to live without. As soon as it left for Mastodon I followed suit</p>
<p>In two weeks no one noticed I’m gone. Sometimes I take a colleague or friend apart and say “so hey since I left Facebook…” and they snap “wait what? did you leave? when?”. It’s actually funny.<br />
The more I stay out of that madhouse, the more I realize how priviledged I am to have that option. Some professionals simply need to have an account and couldn’t live without it. How could live outside of a website become a priviledge?</p>
<p><strong>Political</strong> As of late I’m getting more and more annoyed about the pervasiveness of technology. Sometimes I practice Amish weekends (no computer, mobile, tablet etc. for a weekend) and I won’t deny that when I reached the decision to leave Facebook I had just read two Zerzan books.</p>
<p>My leaving Facebook, however, wasn’t some sort of protest. Some people assume that I left because of Cambridge Analytica or other concerns about my privacy. They call out my not being on Facebook but using Whatsapp or Instagram, two apps from the same company.<br />
I know that since the ideal of the internet was sold in late 90s my data is not safe, I’m not that naive.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional</strong> The decision to leave a place I’ve been for the past 10 years was certainly emotionally charged. I kept thinking about all the things that happened there: the long conversations with my current girlfriend when we just met, the first time I changed my relationship status, all the content that portray a sense of identity. The posts and chats could be saved, what’s not reported in the dump is the likes and shares. I remember one high school teacher I looked up to liked my posts a couple of times, he died about a year after that. That was my last link with him, “X Y liked this”.</p>
<p>Besides the lost mementos, I feel much better. My mood is up, my energy is up. I wasn’t a big Facebook user (I was logging maybe half an hour a day) so this change might be related to the next point.</p>
<p><strong>Social</strong> I left Facebook primarily because I wanted to engage with people. That certainly worked. In the past two weeks I made more connections than in the past two years:<br />
- I joined a group of Haskellers and we’re having a hackaton this weekend!<br />
- I’m chatting semi-regularly with old friends on Whatsapp<br />
- I had small chats with other people on Instagram (I don’t think I had used the messaging feature before)<br />
- I went to the library and actually talked to a human being</p>
<p>Regarding events around me, well, I live in a small city. If something is going down I can read it on the local billboard. If there’s a concert at the pub I’ll see the flyer on my way to the train station. For bigger events in other cities, I can just google for them (e.g. vegan festivals) and note it in the calendar. For tech conferences I either rely on colleagues, Slack, or Twitter.<br />
What I might be missing is news from the local commuters group, but the noise ratio was pretty high there too.</p>
<p>As I recount the networks I’m on right now (Twitter, Mastodon, Goodreads…) I do feel like I miss a soap box. That’s primarily why I decided to revamp these github pages.</p>
